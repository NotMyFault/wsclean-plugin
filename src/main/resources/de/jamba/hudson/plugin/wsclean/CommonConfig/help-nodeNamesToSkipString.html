    List of regular expressions naming nodes to be excluded from cleaning.
    <p>Normally, a node property would be set on a node to indicate
        that it should be excluded from cleanup activities. e.g.
        dynamically-created nodes that are used once and then thrown away.
        However, not all node technologies support node properties, so in this
        case a set of regular expressions can be provided that will be matched
        against the node name and, if any regex matches a node name, that node
        will be excluded from cleanup activities.</p>
    Each (non-empty) line must be a valid regular expression. e.g.
    <code>^docker-.*$</code>
    <p>
        Note: For the purposes of this matching, the name of the controller node
        is the empty string not &quot;master&quot; so, if you want to exclude
        the controller node from cleaning, you'll need to include a line saying
        <code>^$</code>
